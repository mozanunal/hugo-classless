### See it in Action

**[View on GitHub &rarr;](https://github.com/mozanunal/hugo-classless)**

Welcome to **Hugo Classless**, a theme foundation designed to be minimal,
semantic, and incredibly flexible. Instead of locking you into one design, this
theme generates pure, well-structured HTML. This means you can point it to **any
classless CSS framework**—like Pico, Water.css, or Simple.css—and instantly
adopt its appearance.

The best way to understand the concept is to try it yourself. **Use the theme
switcher in the header** to dynamically change the look and feel of this entire
site. You can also **toggle between light, dark, and system mode** using the
icon button in the navbar. Watch how every element adapts instantly. This is the
power of classless CSS!
